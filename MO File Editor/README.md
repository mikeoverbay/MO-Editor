# MO Editor

## A tool to EDIT MO text files in World of Tanks

## BACKUP your files before editing them!

The editor will create a backup when you load a .mo file and change the extension to .mo_BU
You can load the backups in MO but it will save back over the original .mo
The .mo_BU will never be over written.


### How this works:

The .mo files are used to translation to different languages.
MO Editor allows you to search and replace the text in these files as seen on screen.
You should be able to edit any text that's in the game using MO Editor.
The ones you will probably will what to edit are the nation_tankmen.mo files.
Not only can you change the name of the characters, you can also change any string in the file.
You could change "Commander" to "Big Cheese"

### You will need to reload the WoT Client for any changes to be seen!

#### The Path to the .MO files is: World_of_Tanks\res\text\lc_messages


### Use at your own risk..

If you fail to protect your files by backing them up and something goes very wrong, you could fine yourself downloading the entire game again!
