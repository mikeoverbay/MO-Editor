# MO Editor

## A tool to EDIT MO text files in World of Tanks

## BACKUP your files before editing them!

The editor will create a backup when you load a .mo file and change the extension to .mo_BU<br/>
You can load the backups in MO Editor but it will save back over the original .mo<br/>
The .mo_BU will never be over written.<br/>

### How this works:
The .mo files are used for translation of text to different languages.<br/>
MO Editor allows you to search and replace the text in these files as seen on screen.<br/>
You should be able to edit any text that's in the game using MO Editor.<br/>
The ones you will probably will what to edit are the nation_tankmen.mo files.<br/>
Not only can you change the name of the characters, you can also change any string in the file.<br/>
You could change "Commander" to "Big Cheese"

### You will need to reload the WoT Client for any changes to be seen!

#### The Path to the .MO files is: World_of_Tanks\res\text\lc_messages<br/><br/>

Double clicking on a string will select it and copy its name in<br/>

### Use at your own risk..

If you fail to protect your files by backing them up and something goes very wrong, you could fine yourself downloading the entire game again!
